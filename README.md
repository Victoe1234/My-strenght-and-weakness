p align="right">A strenght that I have is that I am able to understand other's feelings very well. Most of my friends go to me for guidance and help with their problems. I consider this a strength becuase not many have the ability to actually listen, give insight, and confort to those who need it. </p>

<h1> My weakness</h1>
<p align="left">A weakness that I have is being too hotheaded. Many people make me mad and I try to keep my cool. Most times I end up losing it or just throw a fit. I want to change this because it makes me seem like I have anger issues, but I do not people just do dumb things.</p>
